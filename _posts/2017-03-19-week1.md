Here's a quick post mortem about our first call. It'll be cool to have a record to both see how much we learn and to synthesize our takeaways. 


### Quick Summary

**Michael** worked with internal tools to update a process with Butterfly. All code changes are reviewed and tested. ***Sometimes it takes days to take one small step.

**Monte** is working on building personal blog with static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that he will [host on AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/websites/getting-started/tutorials/) with this [process](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/swh/website-hosting-intro.html). Don't incorporate a [custom theme](https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter), use it as a reference.

### Takeaways

**Monte's takeaway:**
>Overall I came away feeling better about knowing that dealing with architectural issues is a part of the deal. I guess 'coding' actually isn't the deal, it's about figuring out how pieces fit together and taking on each piece separately.

### Extras

[Sharingan](https://github.com/vipul-sharma20/sharingan/blob/master/README.md)
Shared on Hangouts this week. Cool image analyzer.

>Tool built on Python 3.6 to extract news content as text from newspaperâ€™s photo and perform news context extraction.

[Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/)

Static site generator, a Jekyll cousin built on Python tooling.

[Codeland Conf. April 21-22](http://codelandconf.com/)

I just bought my ticket! It'll probably be tough for you to take off at this point but it'll be great networking with other people in similar positions and I'm sure you could come an after event. I'll learn for both of us.


That's it for this week!
